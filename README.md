# Train Service Delay Notifier üöâ

This Python script monitors Transperth train services and sends you real-time alerts when a delay is detected for your selected line and station. You‚Äôll get both a desktop notification and an SMS alert when your train might be disrupted, giving you time to plan an alternative route.

The script runs every 5 minutes until the service is confirmed to be on time again.

This idea was inspired by a similar course registration project from datababedev, whose approach to scraping and alerting helped shape the initial structure of this tool.

- Uses Selenium to handle dynamic JavaScript-loaded content
- Sends SMS alerts via Twilio when a delay is detected
- Shows desktop notifications for both delays and normal status
- Stores credentials securely using a .env file

## üß† How It Works

- You input your desired train line and station (e.g. ‚ÄúJoondalup‚Äù and ‚ÄúPerth‚Äù)
- The script builds the corresponding Transperth live status URL
- Using Selenium, it loads the site and waits for the dynamic train data table
- BeautifulSoup parses the rendered HTML to check each train‚Äôs status
- If any train shows a delay, you‚Äôll receive:
   - A desktop alert
   - A Twilio SMS to your phone
- The script waits 5 minutes, then checks again ‚Äî repeating until services are confirmed to be on time

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How To Run
From the notificationScript/ folder, run the script:

```bash
python trainNotificationScript.py
```

You‚Äôll be prompted to enter:

- Train line (e.g., Yanchep)
- Station name (e.g., Perth)

If delays are detected, you'll receive:

- A desktop alert
- An SMS with the disruption details

## üîÑ Customization Ideas
- Change notification interval (default is 5 mins)
- Replace Twilio SMS with email or Discord webhooks
- Make it GUI-based with Tkinter or web-based with Flask
- Extend to buses or ferry routes
- Auto-detect your nearest station using location APIs
- Automate to run everyday at your regular travel times

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Will this work with any train line?**  
A: Yes, as long as the line and station exist on the Transperth live times website.

**Q: Can I use this on a schedule?**  
A: Yes, run it in the background or set it up with cron (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows).

**Q: Can I get email alerts instead of SMS?**  
A: This version uses Twilio for SMS. You can modify it to use `smtplib` for email.

**Q: Can I use this without having my laptop running?**  
A: Not by default. This script runs *locally* on your computer, so it only works while your laptop is on and the script is running.

If you want it to run 24/7 without keeping your laptop open, you have a few options:
- Host it on a cloud server
- Use a Raspberry Pi or another device that stays on
- Deploy it on AWS Lambda or another serverless platform
