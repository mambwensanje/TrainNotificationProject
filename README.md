# Train Service Delay Notifier ðŸš‰

This Python script monitors Transperth train services and sends you real-time alerts when a delay is detected for your selected line and station. Youâ€™ll get both a desktop notification and an SMS alert when your train might be disrupted â€” giving you time to plan an alternative route.

The script runs every 5 minutes until the service is confirmed to be on time again.

This idea was inspired by a similar course registration project from datababedev, whose approach to scraping and alerting helped shape the initial structure of this tool.

## How To Use
Run the script with:

```bash
python course_checker.py
```

COMMST3029 might be available! Sending notification...
Twilio text sent! SID: SMxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## How It Works

- The script sends a request to the course registration page using requests
- It uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and search for your course code
- If the course code is found and doesn't say "Full" nearby:
  - It sends a desktop notification using plyer
  - It sends an SMS alert using Twilio
- The script runs every 10 minutes in a loop until the course becomes available

---

## How you can customize it
- Update your Course Code
- Change what the notifications say
- Add a testing feature to test if it works
- Change text notifications to emails or completely change it from SMS to discord or other notification servers
- Remove or update the desktop notifications
- Change the amount of time it takes to refresh the check

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this for a different course?**  
A: Yes! Just change `COURSE_CODE` and `COURSE_URL` in your `.env` file.

**Q: Will this work if the course page is behind a login?**  
A: No, unfortunately the script can only access publicly available pages.

**Q: Can I get email alerts instead of SMS?**  
A: This version uses Twilio for SMS. You can modify it to use `smtplib` for email.

**Q: Can I run this script on a schedule in the background?**  
A: Yes! You can use Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron (Mac/Linux) to run it at intervals.

**Q: Can I use this without having my laptop running?**  
A: Not by default. This script runs *locally* on your computer, so it only works while your laptop is on and the script is running.

If you want it to run 24/7 without keeping your laptop open, you have a few options:
- Host it on a cloud server
- Use a Raspberry Pi or another device that stays on
- Deploy it on AWS Lambda or another serverless platform
